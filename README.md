The 50's "Zippy Zither" Lap Harp is a cool little instrument that you can grab cheaply.
The instrument usually comes with music that slides under the strings and is incredibly easy to start playing.
Unfortunately, apart from the shipped music there are not much more formatted music available online for it. 
Unless you want to learn it traditionally, and not via their innovative fingering scheme.

Therefore, i have created this repo that lets you transpose into the visual scheme. 
It's by no means perfect, and I may be the only person to use it, but if you do use it or want to make it better, go ahead :)
